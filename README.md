# Wizardry 🧙🏾‍♂️

> A great and powerful script for bootstrapping macOS. Forked from [formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation).

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Run

```sh
cd wizardry
./configuratio 2>&1 | tee ~/configuratio.log
```
